Overview: BD Teamsport
======================

Business Development is a team sport.

Players:
 * Sales: who identify opportunities and perform mysterious salescraft
 * Architects: who engage in pre-sales engineering (answer the question "what could we do to help")
 * Delivery Managers: who analyse costs (answer the question "what would we need to do that")
 * Administrative Assistants: who do things we don't have robots for yet
 
This project exists to give this team the systems and processes they need to make that run smoothly.
